# url-shortener
Build a URL Shortener API that helps shorten long URLs.

## Project Description
This project is a full-stack application that provides a URL shortening service. Users can input long URLs, and the service will generate a shorter, more manageable URL. The shortened URL can then be used to redirect to the original long URL. This is particularly useful for sharing links on social media, in emails, or anywhere else where space is limited.
